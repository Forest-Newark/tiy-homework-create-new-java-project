# tiy-homework-create-new-java-project

Create a new Java Project

Create a new Github repository named tiy-homework-create-new-java-project. Clone the repository into your projects directory. This should create a new folder at ~/Projects/tiy-homework-create-new-java-project.

Create a new Java project in IntelliJ and select the ~/Projects/tiy-homework-create-new-java-project directory. This will create the project directly in this folder.

Note: It's a common mistake to create your project in a subfolder of your cloned git repository. For example: ~/Projects/tiy-homework-create-new-java-project/tiy-homework-create-new-java-project. This is not what we want. We want your IntelliJ project to be created so that its root is directly in ~/Projects/tiy-homework-create-new-java-project.

Create a Main class with a main() method.

In the main() method write ten different expressions and output their values to the console.

Add detailed comments to every line of code explaining what's going on.

When done, commit and push your code to Github. Confirm that your code appeared correctly on Github.
